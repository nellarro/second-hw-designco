# DesignCo

This assignment was the second assignment ever received at The Iron Yard. The day before this was my first day of the program and I did not even know what a `div` tag was. 

This project was my introduction to **flexbox** and all of it's wonders. 

Recently, I've decided to re-do this assignment just to brush up on what I know about basic **CSS**. 
The project will *not* have anything in it that I would not have had access to or have known about on Day Two. It should look better than what it did before (*check out the commits in July*) but will not use any more advanced CSS techniques other than flexbox. 

Enjoy!
